                    About Me</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Growing up: I was always ready for an adventure whether that be; walking, cycling and everything in-between. Previously living in an area with great links to the Peak District, I was outside often exploring my local area. Since 2016, I have successfully climbed Mount Snowdon on three occasions (2016, 2020 &amp; 2021) and have also hiked up Mam Tour, Loose Hill, Win Hill &amp; Finally Scafell Pike
<br>I also have ambitious plans for the future which include to climb Ben Nevis and to travel to as many countries as I can.
<br>
<br>In more recent times, I have been limited to where I can go. So I'm really grateful to be in the position which I am in now. Whilst being stuck inside I have taken on challenges I never thought I could do, which was making more than £2,000 online.
<br>I smashed this goal in May 2020.<br><br>I also started my own business from my bedroom in 2018, I used sites like latestdeals.co.uk to make my website known, it was from this moment the sales started rushing in. Originally, I used freewebstore.org to host my online store, which was great for my needs, but after a while they started to display ad's which gave me the impression it was putting people off from buying. To combat this issue, I developed my own website using googiehost and started to advertise on Facebook and Instagram, which was surprisingly cheaper and more simple than I first thought. I then got my first few sales from there and that's when my trustpilot rating started to go up. Unfortunately, after a while of constant sales coming in from multiple platforms such as eBay, Amazon, Etsy &amp; My own website, nobody seemed to be interested anymore. By that point my Domain had expired and it wasn't worth renewing it. I had made over £100 in profit buying in bulk from wish.com and selling it on for just a slight increase in price. This was my main motivator to me and it got me thinking as I really liked taking my time to make everything perfect, and I really enjoyed packing orders. I would do anything for this to happen again.
<br>
<br>In my previous school, I also had the opportunity to participate in whats known as "The Big Challenge" where participants in Year 7, design and create a business. I partnered up with two of my friends and we made a business called "Literary Lanterns" where we imported empty jam jars from Europe and made them into gifts to place around the home. Luckily, our business model was shortlisted as we had the most commitment to making sure everything was perfect. During this experience, I managed everything online. I persuaded my team mates to create a website to sell online, and this boosted our local presence as we had news articles in The Sun &amp; Look Local. When we thought nothing was happening, We were approached by my friends mum who happened to own a training business, and offered her office space and equipment to help us. Shortly after, we were shortlisted and sent on a trip to Sheffield to pitch our idea to a panel of 5 investors. In preparation, we had a 20 page word document printed with our accounts for the previous year and everything we have planned for the future. Investors liked our idea and we were pushed through to 'the next round.' We were then put forward for an award by Yorkshire Bank for the most successful young entrepreneurs in Sheffield. We won £50 each to keep for ourselves. We then decided to donate all profits to charity.<br></p>
